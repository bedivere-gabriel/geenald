  <p>Happy Valentine's day to the love of my life.<br>Thank you for being such a cool and awesome girlfriend and the most supportive person. I know it has not been easy for both of us. I admit that I am not such a perfect guy myself. I make mistakes, hurt you, and most of the time, make you feel helpless. But I am trying to be better day and day. Because I love you, and I will always love you and want you in my life. Honestly, I am fortunate to have you, and I can't wait for the day when we can be together. No matter what happens, through the highs and lows. I will always be here. I will not stop loving you every second of the hour.<br> Baby can you stay with me till the end? :(</p>
